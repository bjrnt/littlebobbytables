Tobii Gaze SDK
--------------

The current implementation of the Tobii Gaze SDK is 
based upon and very similar to the Tobii Analytics SDK, though 
the Gaze SDK is only intended to be used for gaze interaction.

There is no developer's guide for the Tobii Gaze SDK. 
Instead we refer to the Tobii Analytics SDK Developer's Guide
which is adequate also for the Tobii Gaze SDK.

Be advised that the APIs provided by the Gaze SDK are 
expected to change in the future.
